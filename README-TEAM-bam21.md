# Team work is in the [TestDrawBlockD2.fs](./src/Renderer/TestDrawBlockD2.fs) file

## What I have done
1. Helper Functions
    - `printMetrics`: Function that takes in a Sheet model as an input and prints all of that sheet's metrics calculated using the SheetBeautifyHelper functions. Used to check metrics before and after beautification.
    - `findSymbolIdByLabel`: Used in flipSymbol helper function.
    - `flipSymbol`: Takes in a symbol and orientation as input and flips the symbol. Useful to create test circuits with random flips.
    - `beautifySheet`: Function that prints the current test metrics on the model, applies the beautification algorithm and then prints testing metrics again. Gets run by pressing cmd/ctrl 8.

2. Test Circuit
   - Implemented a FlipType\*FlipType\*FlipType generator to generate circuits with all possible flip combinations for 2 MUXes and a Gate
   - Manually defined positions for all symbols within a sheet. 
   - Created a circuit ( `makeCircuit1` ) that takes in a generator as an input and flips MUXes and Gates at every test sample.
   - Circuit gets generated by pressing cmd/ctrl 1 and the next samples are generated by pressing cmd/ctrl 9. Metrics are printed for every sample.

3. Test Menu Functions
   - Added functionality so that a user can beautify the sheet from the Menu.
